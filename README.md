This repository gathers a set of notes, scripts, tips gathered from my linux usage.

I wrote it for myself, but have no reason to keep it private.

Use at your own risks.

Work in progress.


## Bunsenlabs linux config

### Pre-install


* check ssh accesses, be sure not to end up locked down from some server.
* Run backup scripts
* Partition disks


### Post-install

Once bunsen is installed, and bl-welcome has been run:

* execute bunsenLabs-helium-setup
* create ssh keys, and register them to relevant servers
